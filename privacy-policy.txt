Seeing as this extension is very small, we forewent the legalese in favour of an unambiguous PP.

This extension does not collect any personal data about the user whatsoever.
It only intercepts browser requests matching one and only one domain related to the Noita wiki website,
and redirects those to a new wiki site.

We also ask the browser to tell us when the user pressed ENTER so we can send their search query to the new wiki URL.
No information is kept, stored or sent anywhere apart from your search query which is sent to the wiki.

We have no control over what the browser knows about you or what info it collects, we do not need, care about or
have any intention to work with any information coming from or generated by the user unless it is the search
query they voluntarily put into the search box. End of.
