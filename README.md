# Noita Wiki search

This is a browser extension designed to be used in Google Chrome and chromium-based browsers (such as MS Edge) by players of the game Noita.
The purpose of this extension is to provide two benefits:

- An easy to use hotkeyed trigger (`ALT+N`) to enable users to search for information about the game using the [official community wiki](https://noita.wiki.gg/).
- A redirect on searches and links from the old wiki to the new one

This code base was inspired and repurposed from the Path of Exile wiki search extension which can be found [here](https://github.com/Project-Path-of-Exile-Wiki/poe-wiki-search).
